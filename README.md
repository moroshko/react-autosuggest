function getSuggestions(input, callback) {
  const regex = new RegExp('^' + input, 'i');
  const suggestions = suburbs.filter(suburb => regex.test(suburb));

  setTimeout(() => callback(null, suggestions), 300); // Emulate API call
}
```
```xml
<Autosuggest suggestions={getSuggestions} />
```

<a name="suggestionsOption"></a>
#### suggestions (required)

Implement this function to tell Autosuggest which suggestions to display.

```js
function(input, callback) {
  ...
}
```

* `input` - Will be the value of the input field
* `callback` - Should be called once the suggestions are in hand, or error occurs.

  * Success example: `callback(null, `[\<suggestions>](#suggestions)`)`
  * Error example: `callback(new Error("Couldn't get locations"))`

<a name="suggestions"></a>
`<suggestions>` can have one of the following two formats:

* **To display a single section with no title:** `[`[\<suggestion>](#suggestion)`, `[\<suggestion>](#suggestion)`, ...]`
* **To display one or more sections with optional titles:** Array of objects with an optional `sectionName` and a mandatory `suggestions` keys, e.g.:

```js
[{
  suggestions: [<suggestion>, <suggestion>]   // This section won't have a title
}, {
  sectionName: 'Second section',
  suggestions: [<suggestion>, <suggestion>, <suggestion>]
}]
```

<a name="suggestion"></a>
`<suggestion>` can have one of the following two formats:

* String, e.g.: `'Mentone'`
* Object, e.g.: `{ suburb: 'Mentone', postcode: '3194' }`. This object cannot have a `suggestions` key. **You must implement [`suggestionRenderer`](#suggestionRendererOption) and [`suggestionValue`](#suggestionValueOption) in this case.**

<a name="suggestionRendererOption"></a>
#### suggestionRenderer (required when suggestions are objects)

This function will be used to render the suggestion. It should return `ReactElement` or a string.

```js
function(suggestion, input) {
  ...
}
```

* [`suggestion`](#suggestion) - The suggestion to render
* `input` - The value of the input field (e.g.: `'Men'`). If user interacts using the Up or Down keys at the moment, it will be the value of the input field **prior** to those interactions.

For example:

```js
function renderSuggestion(suggestion, input) { // In this example, 'suggestion' is a string
  return (                                     // and it returns a ReactElement
    <span><strong>{suggestion.slice(0, input.length)}</strong>{suggestion.slice(input.length)}</span>
  );
}
```

```xml
<Autosuggest suggestions={getSuggestions}
             suggestionRenderer={renderSuggestion} />
```

<a name="suggestionValueOption"></a>
#### suggestionValue (required when suggestions are objects)

This function will be used to set the value of the input field when suggestion is selected. It has one parameter which is the suggestion object. This function is ignored when suggestions are strings.

For example:

```js
function getSuggestionValue(suggestionObj) {
  return suggestionObj.suburb + ' VIC ' + suggestionObj.postcode;
}
```

```xml
<Autosuggest suggestions={getSuggestions}
             suggestionRenderer={renderSuggestion}
             suggestionValue={getSuggestionValue} />
```

<a name="defaultValueOption"></a>
#### defaultValue (optional)

You may use `defaultValue` only if you want Autosuggest to behave in an [uncontrolled](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/forms.html#uncontrolled-components) manner (the component keeps track of its state internally). In this case you cannot use [`value`](#valueOption).

`defaultValue` is simply the initial value of the input.

For example:

```xml
<Autosuggest suggestions={getSuggestions}
             defaultValue="Mordialloc"
             ... />
```

<a name="valueOption"></a>
#### value (optional)

When specified, Autosuggest behaves in a [controlled](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/forms.html#controlled-components) manner (the component uses an outside source of state).

`value` is simply the value of the input.

For example:

```xml
<Autosuggest suggestions={getSuggestions}
             value={this.state.autosuggestValue}
             ... />
```

When `value` is not specified, Autosuggest behaves in an [uncontrolled](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/forms.html#uncontrolled-components) manner (the component keeps track of its state internally).


<a name="showWhenOption"></a>
#### showWhen (optional)

This function will be used to determine whether to show suggestions or not. It has one parameter which is the value of the input field (e.g.: `'m '`). The default is:

```js
function(input) {
  return input.trim().length > 0;
}
```

For example, this is how you could show suggestions only when user typed 2 or more characters:

```xml
<Autosuggest suggestions={getSuggestions}
             showWhen={input => input.trim().length >= 2} />
```

<a name="onSuggestionSelectedOption"></a>
#### onSuggestionSelected (optional)

This function will be called when suggestion is selected via mouse click or Enter.

```js
function(suggestion, event) {
  ...
}
```

* [`suggestion`](#suggestion) - The selected suggestion
* [`event`][event] - It can be used to call `event.preventDefault()` if the Autosuggest is inside a form and you don't want to submit the form once user selected a suggestion using Enter.

For example:

```js
function onSuggestionSelected(suggestion, event) {
  event.preventDefault();
  // Do other fancy stuff
}
```

```xml
<Autosuggest suggestions={getSuggestions}
             onSuggestionSelected={onSuggestionSelected} />
```

<a name="onSuggestionFocusedOption"></a>
#### onSuggestionFocused (optional)

This function will be called when suggestion is focused via mouse hover or Up/Down keys.

```js
function(suggestion) {
  ...
}
```

* [suggestion](#suggestion) - The focused suggestion

For example:

```js
function onSuggestionFocused(suggestion) { // In this example 'suggestion' is a string
  console.log('Suggestion focused: [' + suggestion + ']');
}
```

```xml
<Autosuggest suggestions={getSuggestions}
             onSuggestionFocused={onSuggestionFocused} />
```

<a name="onSuggestionUnfocusedOption"></a>
#### onSuggestionUnfocused (optional)

This function will be called when suggestion is unfocused.

```js
function(suggestion) {
  ...
}
```

* [suggestion](#suggestion) - The unfocused suggestion

For example:

```js
function onSuggestionUnfocused(suggestion) { // In this example 'suggestion' is a string
  console.log('Suggestion unfocused: [' + suggestion + ']');
}
```

```xml
<Autosuggest suggestions={getSuggestions}
             onSuggestionUnfocused={onSuggestionUnfocused} />
```

<a name="inputAttributesOption"></a>
#### inputAttributes (optional)

Hash of attributes to pass to the input field. For example:

```js
const inputAttributes = {
  id: 'locations-autosuggest',
  name: 'locations-autosuggest',
  className: 'my-sweet-locations-autosuggest',
  placeholder: 'Enter locations...',
  type: 'search',
  onChange: value => console.log(`Input value changed to: ${value}`),
  onBlur: event => console.log('Input blurred. Event:', event)
};
```

```xml
<label htmlFor="locations-autosuggest">Where</label>
<Autosuggest suggestions={getSuggestions}
             inputAttributes={inputAttributes} />
```

<a name="cacheOption"></a>
#### cache (optional)

Defaults to `true`, meaning that the [`suggestions`](#suggestionsOption) function will be called only once for a given input.

For example, if user types `m`, and suggestions are retrieved, we store the result in memory. Then, if user types `e` and hits `Backspace`, we get the suggestions for `m` from the cache.

Set `cache={false}` to disable this behaviour.

<a name="idOption"></a>
#### id (required when multiple Autosuggests are rendered on a page)

The only reason `id` exists, is to set ARIA attributes (they require a unique id).

When rendering a single Autosuggest, don't set the `id` (it will be set to `'1'`, by default).

When rendering multiple Autosuggests, make sure to give them unique `id`s. For example:

```xml
<Autosuggest id="source" suggestions={getSourceSuggestions} />
<Autosuggest id="destination" suggestions={getDestinationSuggestions} />
```

<a name="scrollBarOption"></a>
#### scrollBar (optional)

Set it to `true` only if suggestions container (`react-autosuggest__suggestions`) can have a scroll bar (e.g. if it has `height: 200px; overflow: auto`). Suggestions container must be a [positioned element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/position) in this case. When set to `true`, suggestions container will adjust its scroll bar every time user interacts using the Up and Down keys (see the [this example](https://moroshko.github.io/react-autosuggest#Custom renderer)).

Defaults to `false`.

<a name="themeOption"></a>
#### theme (optional)

Autosuggest comes with no styles, and it supports [react-themeable](https://github.com/markdalgleish/react-themeable).

This means you can use [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules), [Radium](http://projects.formidablelabs.com/radium), [React Style](https://github.com/js-next/react-style), [JSS](https://github.com/jsstyles/jss), inline styles, or even global CSS to style your Autosugest component.

For example, to style the Autosuggest using CSS Modules, do:

```css
/* theme.css */

.root { ... }
.suggestions { ... }
.suggestion { ... }
.suggestionIsFocused { ... }
.section { ... }
.sectionName { ... }
.sectionSuggestions { ... }
```

```js
import theme from 'theme.css';
```
```xml
<Autosuggest theme={theme} ... />
```

When not specified, `theme` defaults to:

```js
{
  root: 'react-autosuggest',
  suggestions: 'react-autosuggest__suggestions',
  suggestion: 'react-autosuggest__suggestion',
  suggestionIsFocused: 'react-autosuggest__suggestion--focused',
  section: 'react-autosuggest__suggestions-section',
  sectionName: 'react-autosuggest__suggestions-section-name',
  sectionSuggestions: 'react-autosuggest__suggestions-section-suggestions'
}
```

An example of styling the Autosuggest using these global classes can be found in [`examples/src/Autosuggest.less`](https://github.com/moroshko/react-autosuggest/blob/master/examples/src/Autosuggest.less)

The following diagrams explain the classes above.
